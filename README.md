# NimbusCRM — Lead Management (ASP.NET Core MVC)

A production-styled ASP.NET Core **MVC** CRM Lead Management module (migrated
from Razor Pages — there is no `Pages/` folder or `PageModel` anywhere in the
project anymore; every screen is a Controller + View). Data is persisted in
PostgreSQL through Entity Framework Core migrations. The application applies
pending migrations and seeds initial settings when it starts.

## What's implemented

1. **Lead CRUD** — Add, Edit and Delete are available from both Lead List
   and Assigned List (pencil / trash icons next to View). Saves post to
   `LeadController.Save` / deletes post to `LeadController.Delete`, which
   call `LeadStore.AddLead` / `UpdateLead` / `DeleteLead`, then redirect back
   to whichever page the request came from (via a `returnUrl` field) so the
   grid reflects the change immediately.
2. **Call popup** — read-only Call History (Date, Time, Call Type, Employee,
   Duration, Status, Conversation/Notes) with dummy data and a single
   **Close** button.
3. **Follow-up popup** — read-only Follow-up details (Date, Time, Type,
   Assigned Employee, Status, Remarks) with a single **Close** button.
4. **Visit information** — Lead List has a **Visit Location** column showing
   the latest visit; Lead Details has a full **Visit History** panel (Visit
   Date, Time, Location, Salesperson, Conversation, Result/Outcome, Remarks)
   with dummy visits seeded on a few leads.
5. **Settings** (`/Settings`) — functional sections for Lead Status, Lead
   Sources, Users/Roles, and Follow-up Settings, all backed by
   `SettingsStore` and editable through the page (add/remove statuses and
   sources, add/remove users, save follow-up defaults). Status/Source/
   Assigned-To dropdowns throughout the app read from this store, so changes
   in Settings show up immediately in the Add/Edit Lead form.

Requirement and Assign/Reassign modals on Lead Details are unchanged, as are
all existing lead fields and the Lead List → View → Lead Details flow.

## Run it

Requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).

```bash
cd CrmLeadManagement
dotnet run
```

Then open the URL shown in the console (typically `https://localhost:5001` or
`http://localhost:5000`) — it redirects straight to the Lead List.

## Routes

- **`/`** — `HomeController.Index` redirects to the Lead List.
- **`/Lead/List`** — Lead List with the full data table (Lead ID, Lead Name,
  Company, Mobile, Email, Status, Source, Assigned To, Follow-up Date,
  Actions). Only a **View** action is exposed here; it navigates to
  `/Lead/Details/LD-1001`.
- **`/Lead/Details/LD-1001`** — Full lead profile. Four action buttons
  (Call, Follow Up, Requirement, Assign/Reassign) open modals with history
  tables/timelines.
- **`/Lead/Assigned`** — Assigned leads with search, status filter, employee
  filter, date filter, pagination controls, View / Edit-Reassign actions,
  and an **Add Lead** button that opens the full Add Lead form in a modal.
- **`/Settings`** — Lead Status, Lead Sources, Users/Roles, Follow-up
  Settings.
- **`POST /Lead/Save`**, **`POST /Lead/Delete`** — shared by both list
  pages; each form carries a hidden `returnUrl` so the user lands back on
  the page they started from.

## JSON REST API (for a separate frontend / backend consumption)

In addition to the MVC pages, this project exposes a plain JSON REST API under
`/api`, backed by the same PostgreSQL data access used by the views. CORS is
configurable with the comma-separated `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment
variable. When it is omitted, the application permits any origin for simple
frontend/API testing; set it in production when the frontend has a known URL.

## Configuration

Set `DATABASE_URL` to Render's PostgreSQL connection URL in production. The
application also accepts `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection`, which is
useful for local development. Both values may be either a PostgreSQL URI or an
Npgsql connection string. No database password or connection string is stored
in the repository.

Render supplies `PORT`; the application listens on that port automatically.
Swagger is available at `/swagger` in every environment.

| POST | `/api/leads` | Create a lead (JSON body: `LeadInputModel`) |
| PUT | `/api/leads/{id}` | Update a lead |

        "leadName": "Test User",
        "companyName": "Test Co",

        "source": "Website",
        "leadStatus": "New",
        "assignedTo": "Ananya Sharma",
        "priority": "Medium"
      }'
```

### Settings — `/api/settings`

| Method | Route | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/settings` | Everything (statuses, sources, users, follow-up defaults) |
| GET / POST | `/api/settings/statuses` | List / add a lead status. POST body: `{ "value": "In Review" }` |

### Running it

```bash
cd CrmLeadManagement
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The MVC pages stay at `http://localhost:5000/` and the API sits alongside at
`http://localhost:5000/api/...` — same process, same port, no extra setup.
New API code lives in `Controllers/Api/` and `Models/Dtos/`; nothing in the
existing controllers, views, or models was changed.
